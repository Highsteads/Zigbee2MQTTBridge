# Filename:    test_version_consistency.py
# Description: Fails when the version signals disagree — the bundle's
#              Info.plist, the README header line, and the README changelog.
# Author:      CliveS & Claude Opus 5
# Date:        29-08-2026
# Version:     1.0
#
# Drift here is silent: nothing breaks when a README advertises a version the
# plugin no longer is, so it accumulates until somebody trips over it.
# ClaudeBridge's header sat six releases behind with its changelog correct the
# whole time, and Ecowitt and ShellyGen1 were each one release behind, all
# found on the same day in Aug-2026. ~/bin/estate-check sweeps for this daily;
# this file is the same check at push time, where CI can refuse it.
#
# Generic on purpose — it finds the bundle by glob, so it can be dropped into
# any Highsteads plugin repo unchanged.
